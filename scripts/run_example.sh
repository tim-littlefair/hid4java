# Wrapper script to run the example programs in subdirectory 
# ./test/java/org/examples of a git checkout of hid4java.

# Note that this script seems to be required for Linux (specifically 
# Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS) because the documented recipe of running 
# examples with a command line like: 
#
# mvn clean test exec:java -Dexec.classpathScope="test" -Dexec.mainClass="org.hid4java.examples.UsbHidEnumerationExample"
#
# does not exit cleanly.

# The examples run to completion as expected, but threads started by the 
# application do not exit promptly when sent an interrupt signal, the shutdown
# process is delayed, and ultimately an exception is thrown reporting
# that a background thread was closed by force.  

# Messages seen when this occurs include:
#
# [WARNING] thread Thread[...] was interrupted but is still alive after waiting at least 15000msecs
# [WARNING] thread Thread[...] will linger despite being asked to die via interruption
# [WARNING] NOTE: ... thread(s) did not finish despite being asked to via interruption. This is not a problem with exec:java, it is a problem with the running code. Although not serious, it should be remedied.

# The following StackOverflow answer suggests that this might be a 
# problem arising because of the fact that when the app is run from 
# Maven it is not allowed to own the main thread, and the operation of 
# the Thread.interrupt() requires the main thread to exit in order
# to unblock and shut down background threads.
